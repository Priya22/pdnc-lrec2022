Such a simple idea not my own. I haven't
got the brains. You see, I wanted to go into the detective service,
especially the anti-dynamite business. But for that purpose they wanted
someone to dress up as a dynamiter; and they all swore by blazes that I
could never look like a dynamiter. They said my very walk was
respectable, and that seen from behind I looked like the British
Constitution. They said I looked too healthy and too optimistic, and
too reliable and benevolent; they called me all sorts of names at
Scotland Yard. They said that if I had been a criminal, I might have
made my fortune by looking so like an honest man; but as I had the
misfortune to be an honest man, there was not even the remotest chance
of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal. But at last I was
brought before some old josser who was high up in the force, and who
seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders. And there the others
all talked hopelessly. One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my
nice smile; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like
a negro anarchist; but this old chap chipped in with a most
extraordinary remark. he said
positively. And so it was, by George! When once my eyes were
covered, all the rest, smile and big shoulders and short hair, made me
look a perfect little devil. As I say, it was simple enough when it was
