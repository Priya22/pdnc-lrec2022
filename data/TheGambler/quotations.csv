With\nthis you, as a Britisher, may not agree. With it I also, as a Russian,\nmay not agree out of envy. Yet possibly our good ladies are of another\nopinion. For instance, one may look upon Racine as a broken-down,\nhobbledehoy, perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him;\nand I too may think him the same, as well as, in some respects, a\nsubject for ridicule. Yet about him, Mr. Astley, there is a certain\ncharm, and, above all things, he is a great poet though one might like\nto deny it. Yes, the Frenchman, the Parisian, as a national figure, was\nin process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians\nhad even ceased to be bears. The Revolution bequeathed to the French\nnobility its heritage, and now every whipper-snapper of a Parisian may\npossess manners, methods of expression, and even thoughts that are\nabove reproach in form, while all the time he himself may share in that\nform neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners,\nand the rest, having come to him through inheritance. Yes, taken by\nhimself, the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of\nvillains. Per contra, there is no one in the world more worthy of\nconfidence and respect than this young Russian lady. De Griers might so\nmask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart, for he\nhas an imposing figure, Mr. Astley, and this young lady might easily\ntake that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart\nand soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him.\nAnd even though it may offend you, I feel bound to say that the\nmajority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined, whereas we\nRussian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it, and are always\neager to cultivate the same. But to distinguish beauty of soul and\npersonal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom\nthan is possessed by our women, especially by our younger ladies. At\nall events, they need more _experience_.

She may respect you, she may become your friend,\nshe may open out her heart to you; yet over that heart there will be\nreigning that loathsome villain, that mean and petty usurer, De Griers.\nThis will be due to obstinacy and self-love to the fact that De Griers\nonce appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis, of a\ndisenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her\nfamily and the frivolous old General; and, although these transactions\nof his have since been exposed, you will find that the exposure has\nmade no impression upon her mind.
