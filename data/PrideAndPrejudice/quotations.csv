kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any
thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.""",Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth'],Anaphoric,he continued,"[['the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness', 'she', 'her', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Miss de Bourgh', 'she'], ['my fair cousin', 'Lady Catherine de Bourgh', 'You', 'her', 'your ', 'her', 'her', 'you', 'your honoured\nfather', 'his daughters', 'them', 'my fair cousin', 'your', 'you', 'your father', 'yours', 'your mother', 'you', 'you', 'yourself', 'we']]","[[[184757, 184820], [184832, 184835], [184860, 184863], [185005, 185019], [185034, 185048], [185068, 185071]], [[185463, 185477], [185527, 185551], [185611, 185614], [185625, 185628], [185674, 185679], [185726, 185729], [185791, 185794], [185993, 185996], [186113, 186133], [186251, 186264], [186283, 186287], [186454, 186468], [186514, 186518], [186572, 186575], [186721, 186732], [186859, 186864], [186876, 186887], [186911, 186914], [186998, 187001], [187013, 187021], [187079, 187081]]]","[[['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Mrs. Jenkinson'], ['Miss De Bourgh'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']], [['Elizabeth'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Lady Catherine De Bourgh'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Mr. Bennet'], ['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane'], ['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Mr. Bennet'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Mrs. Bennet'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Elizabeth'], ['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Collins']]]"
